# Assets Directory

This directory contains placeholder assets for the Visual Search app prototype.

## Structure

- `icons/` - SVG icons and icon assets
- `examples/` - Example images for demonstration
- `placeholders/` - Placeholder images and graphics

## Note

In this prototype, most images are generated using inline SVG data URLs for simplicity. In a production version, this directory would contain:

- High-quality product images
- Example photos for demonstrations
- Icon sets and graphics
- Brand assets and logos
- Placeholder images for loading states

## Current Implementation

The prototype uses:

- Inline SVG data URLs for all images
- CSS gradients for placeholder backgrounds
- System icons via SVG paths
- No external image dependencies

This approach ensures the prototype works without any external assets and loads quickly for demonstration purposes.

## 🎨 Design System

### CSS Architecture

The project follows a layered CSS architecture:

1. **Tokens** (`tokens.css`) - Design variables and constants
2. **Base** (`base.css`) - Global styles and resets
3. **Utilities** (`utilities.css`) - Helper classes
4. **Components** (`components.css`) - Reusable UI components
5. **Layouts** (`layouts.css`) - Page structure and positioning
6. **Themes** (`themes.css`) - Theme-specific overrides
7. **Print** (`print.css`) - Print media styles

### Naming Convention

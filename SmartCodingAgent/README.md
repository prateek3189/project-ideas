# Smart Coding Agent - Static HTML/CSS Prototype

> **A developer assistant prototype built with pure HTML and CSS** - no JavaScript, no real execution, no AI integration. All functionality is visual placeholders designed to demonstrate the potential for AI-assisted development workflows.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Smart Coding Agent is a **static HTML + CSS v1 prototype** of a developer assistant (like "Junie") that helps debug, write, and optimize code live. This prototype demonstrates a unified workspace that blends code view, chat, actions (fix/optimize/test), and diff review.

### Key Features

- **Single Workspace**: Code view, chat, actions, and context panel in one interface
- **Traceable Suggestions**: Clear reasoning, risk assessment, and implementation details
- **Fast & Accessible**: Clean theming (light/dark/high-contrast) with print-friendly layouts
- **Visual Placeholders**: All "AI" functionality represented through static examples

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser
3. **Navigate** through the different pages using the sidebar
4. **Explore** the various features and components

No build process, no dependencies, no server required!

## 🎨 Design System

### CSS Architecture

The project uses a **layered CSS architecture** with design tokens:

1. **`tokens.css`** - Colors, spacing, typography, and design variables
2. **`base.css`** - Reset, typography, and foundational styles
3. **`utilities.css`** - Grid, flexbox, spacing, and utility classes
4. **`components.css`** - Reusable UI components with BEM methodology
5. **`layouts.css`** - Shell, 3-pane layout, and responsive systems
6. **`themes.css`** - Light/dark/high-contrast theme implementations
7. **`print.css`** - Print-optimized styles for reports and diffs

### Color System

- **Light Theme**: Clean whites and grays with blue accents
- **Dark Theme**: Dark backgrounds with light text and blue accents
- **High Contrast**: Maximum contrast for accessibility
- **Semantic Colors**: Success (green), warning (yellow), danger (red), info (blue)

### Typography

- **Sans-serif**: System font stack for UI text
- **Monospace**: `ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Consolas` for code
- **Scale**: 12px to 36px with consistent line heights

## 📱 Pages & Features

### 1. Workspace (`index.html`)

- **3-pane layout**: Code view, chat, and context panel
- **Interactive elements**: Action buttons, chat interface, file tree
- **Code annotations**: Error markers, inline comments, syntax highlighting

### 2. Diff Review (`diff.html`)

- **Unified & split views**: Side-by-side code comparison
- **Risk analysis**: Impact assessment and change summaries
- **File tree**: Changed files with insert/delete counts

### 3. Tests (`tests.html`)

- **Coverage ring**: Visual coverage percentage with breakdown
- **Test cases**: Suggested test scenarios with priorities
- **Scaffolds**: Language-specific test templates
- **Flaky detection**: Heuristics for identifying unreliable tests

### 4. Performance (`perf.html`)

- **Hotspots list**: Performance bottlenecks with complexity bars
- **Budget monitoring**: p95 latency, memory, CPU, bundle size
- **Optimization suggestions**: Algorithmic and micro-optimizations
- **Before/after comparison**: Projected performance improvements

### 5. Playbooks (`playbooks.html`)

- **Debug workflows**: Systematic debugging methodologies
- **Optimization recipes**: Performance improvement strategies
- **Testing practices**: Comprehensive testing approaches
- **Deployment guides**: Safe shipping and migration strategies

### 6. Settings (`settings.html`)

- **AI model configuration**: Model selection, context window, temperature
- **Appearance options**: Themes, fonts, accessibility settings
- **Privacy controls**: Data handling, telemetry, API key management
- **Project scope**: File types, ignore patterns, safety warnings

### 7. About (`about.html`)
